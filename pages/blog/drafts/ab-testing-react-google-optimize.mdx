# Server-side A/B Testing with React: Next.js, GraphQL and Google Optimize

## Learn how to easily run experiments on your webapp, for free.

As we will use Google Optimize to run experiments, this tutorial suppose that you use Google Analytics to track your metrics. If you don't, I suggest you use Segment to also send events to GA.

Also note that the code samples are in TypeScript. And we use hooks so you need React >= 16.8.
