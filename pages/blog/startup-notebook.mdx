# Startup Notebook

## Open Source Notebook about Starting a Startup

Work in progress... I'm gathering all my learnings from the last three years.

Obviously I still have a lot to learn. That's why I want this notebook to be collaborative. **You can collaborate by opening a pull request on GitHub!** Click on the top right "edit" button to find the repo.

The idea of this notebook is to link an in-depth post to each point.

### Start

[] Problem

Understand the problem you are trying to solve. Deeply understand it. Code: help you understand.

[] Solution

Remember: fall in love with the problem, not the solution.

[] Get your first user

This is probably the most important step. Fake it until you make it. Be intense.

[] Build a product

OK, you have the first version now? Launch! Now! Have someone to use your product and iterate. At this stage, your success rate is your iteration rate.

[] Go fast

Now you have the right mindset. Just do it.

[] Talk to your users

Don't be shy.

Seems counterintuitive, but once you started a discussion with a user, like a usability testing - stop talking. Really, don't talk. Listen to the user and let him use the product. Listen.

[] Track your metrics

But don't forget that you'll learn more from talking to your users.

[] Pitch

One rule: always be ready.

[] Ask for Office Hours

[] Apply to YC

[] Keep a great co-founder relationship

[] Raise money

[] Find product/market fit

Pre-product market fit  —  do things that don't scale: remain small/nimble.

### Grow

[] Experiment

Growth: analytics, data analysis, user research, user testing, running A/B tests, sharing learnings, etc...

[] Culture

Define your values before hiring anyone. Just think about what makes you, you.

[] Hire the best people

Think of a 10% equity hire. Don't hire too fast. "Don't scale your team/product until you have built something people want."

[] Survive

Be resilient.

[] Succeed

Just survive long enough. Ask for what you want.

### Bonus

To be a great founder, and mostly a good person.

[] Be earnest

Because it's [important and powerful](/blog/the-importance-of-being-earnest).

[] Be nice

Consider the time of others.

[] Sleep

[] Vision

You are in it for the long haul. Be mindful, you are putting bricks to build a skyscraper.

[] Habits

Kill your bad habits and create healthy ones.

[] Learn

Learn everyday. Read books. Small hack: surround yourself with books and consider them as web content. It's easier to create a habit if your environment is propitious and if it's easy to do.

[] Remove the ego

[] Deliver quality

[] Do it again. Do it again. Do it again
