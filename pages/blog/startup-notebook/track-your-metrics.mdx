# Startup Notebook

## Track your metrics

[] Define what is an "active" user

[] Define what is your core value

[] Define what is your retention - pick a leading indicator of revenue and repeat behavior

[] Define what is your Magic Moment

[] Define what is your North Star

[] Implement Segment

[] Track every action. Define a tracking plan to make it easy to keep track of everything. Define a naming convention for your events, like the [object-action framework](https://segment.com/academy/collecting-data/naming-conventions-for-clean-data/)

[] Send everything to Amplitude

[] Create a dashboard with your key metrics and look at it every day (but not too much, keep coding)

[] Always look at your week-over-week growth rate and compound week-over-week growth rate. The goal is 7% every week ;)
