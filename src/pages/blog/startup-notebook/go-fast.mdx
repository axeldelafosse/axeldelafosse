# Startup Notebook

## Go fast

[] Adopt a growth mindset

[] Learn everyday

[] Decide on who is responsible for the product. Tips: you can set two months period to avoid co-founder dispute. The person responsible will always have the last words on what to do

[] Ask for help if you're stuck

[] Don't focus on making your code perfect. [Actually, take on as much technical debt as you can stand](https://twitter.com/paulg/status/1082268906201456640)

[] Don't focus on scalability, yet

[] Don't wait to have enough data to validate your hypothesis. Talk to your users and follow your gut

[] Be relentlessly resourceful
