## Problem

[] Write down the problem you are trying to solve. Make it crystal clear

[] What is the definition of the problem in the words of your users?

[] Ask yourself, "How can we solve this problem?"

[] Talk with people experiencing this problem

[] Read about it, mostly in books if it's an old problem. You'll think that you have a new idea but it's probably wrong

[] Frequency? Intensity?

[] Choose a focus

[] Define your mission
