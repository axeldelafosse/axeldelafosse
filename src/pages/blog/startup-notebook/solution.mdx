# Startup Notebook

## Solution

[] Create value. Define your value proposition

[] What are the alternatives?

[] Fake it until you make it

[] Prototype

[] Iterate and create the Minimum Lovable Product quickly

[] But... Don't serve burnt pizza.

“Say you’re trying to test whether people like pizza. If you serve them burnt pizza, you’re not getting feedback on whether they like pizza. You only know that they don’t like burnt pizza. Similarly, when you’re only relying on the MVP, the fastest and cheapest functional prototype, you risk not actually testing your product, but rather a poor or flawed version of it.” - [Jiaona Zhang](https://firstround.com/review/dont-serve-burnt-pizza-and-other-lessons-in-building-minimum-lovable-products/)
