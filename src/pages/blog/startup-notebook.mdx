# Startup Notebook

## Open Source Notebook about Starting a Startup

Work in progress... I'm gathering all my learnings from the last three years. Obviously I still have a lot to learn. That's why I want this notebook to be collaborative. **You can collaborate by opening a pull request on GitHub!** Click on the top right "edit" button to find the repo.

If you are starting a startup, you can easily copy the "to-do list" to a Notion note and work from there. Starting a startup isn't about checking boxes, but it helps to have a structure.

### Start

[] <Link href="startup-notebook/problem">Problem</Link>

Understand the problem you are trying to solve. Deeply understand it. Code: help you understand.

[] <Link href="startup-notebook/solution">Solution</Link>

Remember: fall in love with the problem, not the solution.

[] <Link href="startup-notebook/get-your-first-user">Get your first user</Link>

This is probably the most important step. Fake it until you make it. Be intense.
PS: it's easier when _you_ are the user.

[] <Link href="startup-notebook/build-a-product">Build a product</Link>

OK, you have the first version now? Launch! Now! Have someone to use your product and iterate. At this stage, your success rate is your iteration rate.

[] <Link href="startup-notebook/go-fast">Go fast</Link>

Now you have the right mindset. Just do it.

[] <Link href="startup-notebook/talk-to-your-users">Talk to your users</Link>

Don't be shy.

Seems counterintuitive, but once you started a discussion with a user, like a usability testing - stop talking. Really, don't talk. Listen to the user and let him use the product. Listen.

[] <Link href="startup-notebook/track-your-metrics">Track your metrics</Link>

But don't forget that you'll learn more from talking to your users.

[] Pitch

One rule: always be ready.

[] <Link href="startup-notebook/office-hours">Ask for Office Hours</Link>

[] Apply to YC

[] Keep a great co-founder relationship

[] Raise money

[] Find product/market fit

Pre-product market fit  —  do things that don't scale: remain small/nimble.

### Grow

[] Experiment

Growth: analytics, data analysis, user research, user testing, running A/B tests, sharing learnings, etc...

[] Culture

Define your values before hiring anyone. Just think about what makes you, you.

[] Hire the best people

Think of a 10% equity hire. Don't hire too fast. "Don't scale your team/product until you have built something people want."

[] Survive

Be resilient.

[] Succeed

Just survive long enough. Ask for what you want.

### Bonus

To be a great founder, and mostly a good person.

[] Be earnest

Because it's [important and powerful](/blog/the-importance-of-being-earnest).

[] Be nice

Consider the time of others.

[] Sleep

[] Vision

You are in it for the long haul. Be mindful, you are putting bricks to build a skyscraper.

[] Habits

Kill your bad habits and create healthy ones.

[] Learn

Learn everyday. Read books. Small hack: surround yourself with books and consider them as web content. It's easier to create a habit if your environment is propitious and if it's easy to do.

[] Remove the ego

[] Deliver quality

[] Do it again. Do it again. Do it again

[] Art of Trust

"Try to optimize for trust. Try to view every challenge as a trust-building opportunity" — Parting advice from Ali: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HDO1p3VdYg
